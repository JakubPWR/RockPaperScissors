# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. Players can choose between rock, paper, and scissors to compete against a computer opponent. The game tracks wins, losses, and draws, providing a simple yet engaging experience.

## Features

- Choose between rock, paper, and scissors with visually appealing buttons.
- Displays the number of wins, losses, and draws.
- Reset the game to clear the score.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for buttons and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic for determining the winner and managing the score.

## How It Works

1. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the corresponding button.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The game compares the player’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw).
4. The results are displayed, and the score is updated accordingly.
5. The game can be reset to start a new session.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click on the buttons to play the game!

## Future Enhancements
